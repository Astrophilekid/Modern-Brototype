Hello devs ðŸš€. I choosed Brototype's official webiste itself to clone as part of 30-Day insta coding challenge.
Even though the challenge was to "clone", instead of cloning, I tried to completely redesign the UI and make it more modern and futuristic.
To visit the page, clone the repository and open with live server extension in vs code. or visit the following link :
